In this one, i'll be posting the codes for all cpp programs that I create. 

getline() with cin causes weird behaviour.  Basically, FORMATTED I/O & UNFORMATTED I/O
same thing happens in java

best fix- If you choose to read everything as strings using the unformatted operations you can convert them into the appropriate types afterwards.
